Description of project: 

This repository is for an undergraduate directed studies project conducted at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre (Bamfield, BC). The project focused on the effects of short-term heatwaves on the temperate intertidal anemone species Anthopleura elegantissima and their algal symbionts (zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae). This repository includes all data (raw and cleaned), plots, and the code used to create plots and analyze the data. The files aggregating_anemone_analyses_cache and aggregating_anemone_analyses_files contain saved outputs for the code in aggregating_anemone_analyses.
