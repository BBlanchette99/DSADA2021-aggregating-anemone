Description of project: 

This repository is for an undergraduate directed studies project conducted at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre (Bamfield, BC). The project focused on the effects of short-term heatwaves on the temperate intertidal anemone species Anthopleura elegantissima and their algal symbionts (zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae). This repository includes all data (raw and cleaned), plots, and the code used to create plots and analyze the data. There are separate data files for all measurements that were collected. These include photosynthetic efficiency, cell density and mitotic index, anemone base diameter, anemone feeding time, and behavioural response measurements.
